- 👋 Hello, my name is Kirill, I am 24 years old, now I am a PTO engineer at a construction site, I am engaged in as-built and accompanying documentation, BUT I really want to change my specialty, because I understand that I do not like my job.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and in the IT field in general, in which I do not understand anything, but I really want to learn something
- 🌱At the moment I am studying the Python programming language and reading books on it, I also plan to continue my studies
- 💞️ I am looking for opportunities to collaborate, perhaps even to train and guide me on the right path as a young Jedi.
- 📫 To reach me Telegram: @Yakira666
