- 👋 Hello, my name is Kirill, I am 25 years old, now I am a PTO engineer at a construction site, I am engaged in executive and accompanying documentation, I want to change my specialty, because I don’t like my job.

👀 I'm interested in coding and IT in general, I like to solve problems and learn a lot of new things, I've been actively studying for 6 months already.

🌱At the moment I am writing in Python and gradually I understand it better, I solve problems on codewars, I read books, I also work with tutors.

💞️ I am looking for opportunities for cooperation, perhaps an evening internship after my main job.
