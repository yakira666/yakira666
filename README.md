- 👋 Hi, I’m @yakira666 now I am an engineer of the production and technical department at a construction site, 
     BUT I want to change my specialty, since I always chose a computer more. 
     Although now I work for a PC, but the specificity is not at all the same, I understand that this is not mine
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and in the IT field in general, in which I do not understand anything, but I really want to learn something
- 🌱I am currently studying Python programming and have almost completed the first course, I plan to continue my studies as well
- 💞️ I am looking for opportunities to collaborate, perhaps even to train and guide me on the right path as a young Jedi.
